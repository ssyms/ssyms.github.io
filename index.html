               I volunteer at the Science Club for Girls on  their Tech Team
               program, which teaches girls about programming and entrepreneurship.
               The participants also compete in Technovation, which
               challenges girls to develop an app and business model that will
               address a problem in their community. During the first year of the
               program, I helped develop lesson plans and worked with the girls
               on their apps. Currently, the program is in it's third year, and
               continues to accept returning and new members.

               <b>Society of Women Engineers Outreach</b><br>
               I have been a member of the Society of Women Engineers since my
               first semester at college, and have volunteered at several outreach
               events such as the Strides for Breast Cancer Walk and the Habitat for Humanity ReStore Day.
               In my sophomore year, I organized Northeastern Universityâ€™s Women in
               Engineering Day, which introduced high school girls to various facets
               of engineering through panels and activities and was attended by over 100 people.

               </div>
               Since my first semester at college, I've been engaged with research on campus.
               My freshmen and sophomore years I worked with the Northeastern University Computer
               Architecture Lab developing benchmarks for CUDA, OpenCL, and OpenMP.
               At the end of my sophomore year, I worked with PhD students in the College
               of Computer and Information Science
               to test and develop a demo for Hyperdrive, a cloud testbed to support research
               on attacks and mitigations on cloud systems, for which I received a
               <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7943500/">publication
               credit</a>. I also received a RISE (Research, Innovation, Scholarship, and
               Entrepreneurship) Award for my work with Enabling Engineering on developing a wearable
               device that will enable therapists to monitor their clients' remote physical therapy.

                <p>I created a human vs computer Connect Four game in React, and implemented
                  a Minimax algorithm to choose the computer's next move. The algorithm
                  uses a ratings function to assign a score to a column and looks several
                  turns ahead to predict the best move. The most challenging part was
                  part was finding the balance between minimizing threats
                  (the human player wins) and maximizing potential wins.

                  Proxies are used to provide additional security and privacy
                  to internet users, although they are used for illegal

                <p>Due to the hard work of non-profits and new forensic techniques,
                  each year dozens of innocent men and women have their convictions reversed
                  and are released from prison. There are many reasons an individual may not get
                  a fair trail, including an inadequate defense, flawed forensic evidence, mistaken
                  witness testimony, and police misconduct. This Jupyter notebook
                   uses pandas and plot.ly to conduct a data exploration of the context
                  in which exonerations take place.

                  our team has been developing a wearable that connects with an iOS
                  application to monitor remote physical therapy for chidren with cerebral palsy.
                  The goal is to "gamify" the physical therapy to encourage participation. The
                  app also connects with an online database that therapists can access
                  to study their clients' progress. This project won the Research,

                <p>This project was created at the first Husky Hacks (also my own
                  first hackathon). Our group developed an internet radio station
                  using Icecast that would allow users to broadcast music live over the
                  internet, allowing friends to listen to music together even
                  if they were across the country. We looked at many different tools
                  before selecting Icecast, a streaming music server. Much of the project
                  was spent on research, connecting to the server, and developing a frontend.

                <p>Made the summer after my freshman year of college, Bites was my
                  first major project outside of class. The goal was to create an iOS
                  app that would allow users to search nearby restaraunts, select a few,
                  and email or text them to their friends. It uses Foursquare's API
                  to find nearby restaraunts and parses information on price range,
                  food category, and ratings from the JSON response. While very simple, it was my first time
                  using Github, working in iOS and Swift, working with APIs and JSON,
                  and generally programming on my own.
